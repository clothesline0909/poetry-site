parameters of the room.
 
Outside, my mother stitched
whole dresses for $3.00 a piece.
 
I slept in a bedroom
which faced the street.
 
A cheerleader was killed
in a drive-by that year.
 
She died in her sleep.
 
I watched the headlights
sweep overhead.
 
          *
 
It felt like skin.
 
It did not
feel obscene.
 
When that boy
tongue-kissed me
 
and wiped
his mouth,
 
it was a coming
into knowledge.
 
          *
 
When my mother whispered,
Has anyone touched you there?
I had to pick.
 
Alan, I said.
 
I was seven.
The training wheels
were coming off.
 
Between the couch
and wall, the ceiling was white
with popcorn bits. The boys stood
 
and watched. I lay there,
my eyes open like a dollâ€™s.
Someone said, Let me try.
 
He pulled down his pants
and rode on top,
then abruptly stopped.
 
The boys laughed,
said Shhh
and stood me up."
