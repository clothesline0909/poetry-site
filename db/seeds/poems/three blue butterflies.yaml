Foiled acqua-
moiré wings the
butterfly’s beauty-
mark hydraulic in its
purposes   his
hair’s flame lifts
you snarls you

 
II. MORPHO ACHILLES
 
Sea-bed in semaphore / an
eyepiece     wing-span
delft dye vat-dipped shingle
scintilla        :        truant
and acclimate     enfold
or infuriate:     SOS:
Don’t surround
Don’t surround
yourself with yourself

 
III. MORPHO RHETENOR HELENA
 
Neon heather sky-
lit bluer than moiré:
 
inseam of street
trash     lush mask-
 
contour     soul-
strait fungible
 
as raiment in the
crawlspace     radiating
 
amatory birds’
egg bulls-eye"
