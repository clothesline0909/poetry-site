title: "Because I Will Be Silenced"
author: "Ha Jin"

text: "Once I have the freedom to say
my tongue will lose its power.
Since my poems strive to break the walls
that cut off peopleâ€™s voices,
they become drills and hammers.
 
But I will be silenced.
The starred tie around my neck
at any moment can tighten into a cobra.
 
How can I speak about coffee and flowers?"
